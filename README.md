## Base plotting
My repository contains 4 scripts and 4 pictures for first course project assignement in Coursera Data Science course
"Exploratory Analysis".
Each script uses the data from this dataset: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip
It has to be unzipped, and the .txt file household_power_consumption.txt has to be put in R working directory.
I include the txt file into my repository for your convenience.

###So feel free to open each of the scripts: 
plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R or plot4.R or any of the pictures.
Comments in each .R script are pretty explanatory, so you shouldn't have any problems understanding what is going on.
